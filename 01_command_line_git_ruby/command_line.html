# Commands

The program that runs inside Terminal and allows you to enter commands is called a "shell"

The default and most commonly used shell on Unix-based OSes (Mac/Linux) is called "bash"

    .terminal
    prompt command -s --option argument1 argument2

The prompt usually has your current directory and ends with a `$` characters, but it can be customized

Switches are one letter and start with one hyphen

Options are multiple letters and start with two hyphens

Each command is actually a separate program, not part of bash

Unix-based OSes come with a standard set of programs

You can install additional programs or write your own and use them in bash

The following slides cover some commonly used commands

Bash is a programming language and has things common to all programming languages, such as commands, strings and variables

In all of the following examples, when there is a `$`, that means you should type the following command **not** including the `$` at the command-line prompt. Other lines are the output of the command.

---

# echo

If you want to print something out, you use `echo`. You put what you want printed between quotes:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ echo 'Hello, $USER'
    Hello, $USER

]

The text between the quotes is called a **string**, because it is a set of characters strung together. The concept of a string exists in every programming language.

Since we used single quotes, the string was printed out exactly as we typed it in. Let's see what happens when you use double quotes:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ echo "Hello, $USER"
    Hello, paul

]

This time, the value of the variable called `USER` was printed out. When you have a `$` sign in front of some letters, when you use a double-quoted string, the value of the variable included in the output, instead of the literal text.

You can also leave out the quotes and just print the value of the variable directly:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ echo $USER
    paul

]

If you leave out the `$`, it will output just the literal string:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ echo USER
    USER

]

So you actually don't need quotes at all if you are printing out a string that has no spaces or other special characters.

So how do you know what all the current variables are?

---

# env

In Bash, the variables are stored in your *environment*. You can use the `env` command to print out all the variables that are set and their value:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ env
    TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app
    TERM=xterm
    SHELL=/bin/bash
    TMPDIR=/var/folders/0q/x3mx7qv93wddwpvz69p88l3h0000gn/T/
    USER=paul
    PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin:bin
    PWD=/Users/paul/dev/back-end-web-development
    EDITOR=subl -w
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    PS1=$
    HOME=/Users/paul
    ...
]

There is a lot of stuff, so I've truncated the output. We'll talk about some of these variables soon and what they do, but first, let's make it easier to read this output

---

# sort

In Unix, if you want to modify the output of a program, you can pipe the output of one command into the input of another, using the `|` *(pipe)* character:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ env | sort
    EDITOR=subl -w
    HOME=/Users/paul
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin:bin
    PS1=$
    SHELL=/bin/bash
    TERM=xterm
    TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app
    TMPDIR=/var/folders/0q/x3mx7qv93wddwpvz69p88l3h0000gn/T/
    USER=paul

]

`sort` is a command that prints each line of its input in alphabetically order. By using the `|`, we are piping the output of `env` to the input of `sort` and then we see the output of `sort` printed out.

This is helpful, but if what if we want to see the value of a specific variable, rather than look though the whole sorted list?

---

# grep

.small[

    .terminal
    $ env | grep USER
    USER=paul

]

In this example, we are using pipe again, but this time to pipe the output to a command called `grep`

`grep` will search through its input and only print the lines that match the string you give it.

Grep is definitely an odd name, google it if you are interested in the origin.

---

# pwd

One of the main reasons for using the command-line is for working with files

When you are in a bash shell, you are always *in* a directory (a.k.a folder) of your computer. The directory you are in is refered to as your **working directory**, or **current working directory**.

Use the `pwd` command to see what directory you are currently in:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ pwd
    /Users/paul

]

This is my home directory and using the default configuration of your Terminal and bash, you will start in your home directory

`pwd` stands for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory.

---

# ls

list the contents of a directory with `ls`:

.small[

    .terminal
    ~ $ ls
    Applications  Documents   Dropbox   Movies  Pictures  VirtualBox VMs  certs  dotfiles  ls
    Desktop       Downloads   Library   Music   Public    bin             dev    lb        src
]

use -l for the long format

.small[

    .terminal
    ~ $ ls -l
    total 0
    drwx------    3 paul  staff   102 Jan 20  2013 Applications
    drwx------+  19 paul  staff   646 Sep  6 16:26 Desktop

# Paths

On all Unix-based OSes, including Mac OS X, all files and folders on your computer are stored in a hierachical tree structure. There is only only top-level directory and it is called the *root directory* and it is represented with just `/` characters.

For any file or folder (a.k.a directory) on your computer, the location that is stored at is called a *path*, because it represents the path through the tree of directories that you must go through to get to the file.

A path looks like this:

    .terminal
    /Users/paul/something.txt

The directories in the path are separated by `/` *(forward slash)* characters. This means that there is a directory called `Users` in the root directory, and in that directory called there is a directory called `paul`, and in that directory there is a file called `something.txt`.

---

# brew

There is a nifty program that displays the files and folders in a tree structure, but it's not installed by default. You have to use `brew` to install it.

If you don't already have brew installed, go to [http://brew.sh](http://brew.sh) to get the one-liner that you paste into your Terminal to install it.

The program to view a directory structure is called `tree` and you can install it via `brew` like this:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ brew install tree
    ==> Downloading http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/src/tree-1.6.0.tgz
    ######################################################################## 100.0%
    ==> make prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/tree/1.6.0 MANDIR=/usr/local/Cellar/tree/1.6.0/share/man/man1
    /usr/local/Cellar/tree/1.6.0: 7 files, 116K, built in 2 seconds

]

---

# tree

Now that you have `tree` installed, you can run it like these to see everything 2 levels down from the root:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ tree / -L 2
    /
    ├── Applications
    │   ├── 1Password.app
    │   ├── Alfred.app
    │   ├── Safari.app
    ├── Library
    │   ├── Developer
    │   ├── Frameworks
    │   ├── Ruby
    ├── System
    │   └── Library
    ├── Users
    │   ├── Shared
    │   └── paul
    ├── bin
    │   ├── cp
    │   ├── ls
    │   ├── pwd
    │   └── rm
    └── usr
        ├── bin
        └── local
]

You will actually see a lot more output than that, this is a trimmed-down version

---

# mkdir

To create a new directory, use `mkdir`:

    .terminal
    $ mkdir bewd

If it worked, `mkdir` has no output. You will just be back at the prompt again. If something went wrong, then the error would be printed.

---

# cd

Change into a directory with `cd`:

    .terminal
    $ cd bewd
    $ pwd
    /Users/paul/bewd

Use `..` as an argument to cd to go back up one directory:

    .terminal
    $ cd ..
    $ pwd
    /Users/paul

Use `cd` with no arguments to go back to your home directory:

    .terminal
    $ cd bewd
    $ pwd
    /Users/paul/bewd
    $ cd
    $ pwd
    /Users/paul

---

# Redirect output into a file

We saw early that you can print out a string using `echo`. Similar to the pipe, you can use a `>` greater than symbol put the output of the command into a new file:

    .terminal
    $ echo 'Hello, World' > hello.txt

Now if you print out the list of files in the current working directory, you will see that a new file has been created:

    .terminal
    $ ls
    hello.txt

Output redirection operator does not only apply to `echo` command. You can redirect the output of any command into a file. For example:

    .terminal
    $ ls > ls.txt
    $ ls
    hello.txt
    ls.txt

We redirected the output of `ls` to a file named `ls.txt`. We then see the file was created.

---

# cat

You can print the contents of the file with `cat` _(short for concatenate)_:

    .terminal
    $ cat hello.txt
    Hello, World

You can append more text to a file using the output redirection append operator `>>`:

    .terminal
    $ echo 'Hello, Again' >> hello.txt
    $ cat hello.txt
    Hello, World
    Hello, Again

If you use the regular output redirection operator `>`, that will overwrite the contents of the file if it exists:

    .terminal
    $ echo 'Hello, World' > hello.txt
    cat hello.txt
    Hello, World

---

# mv

Move or rename a file with `mv`:

    .terminal
    $ mv hello.txt hello_world.txt
    $ cat hello_world.txt
    Hello, World

---

# cp

Copy a file with `cp`:

    .terminal
    $ cp hello_world.txt hello2.txt
    $ ls
    hello_world.txt  hello.txt

---

# rm

Use rm to remove a file

    .terminal
    $ ls
    hello.txt   hello_world.txt
    $ rm hello_world.txt
    $ ls
    hello.txt

Use the `-r` switch (short for "recursive") to remove a directory

    .terminal
    $ cd ..
    $ rm bewd
    rm: bewd: is a directory
    $ rm -r bewd
    $ ls bewd
    ls: bewd: No such file or directory

Some OSes/settings may also require you to use `-f` to force a directory to be removed if it is not empty

---

# history

Bash keeps track of what you've done

    .terminal
    $ history
       18  ls
       19  ls -l
       20  pwd
       21  mkdir bewd
       22  cd bewd
       23  echo 'Hello'
       24  echo 'Hello' > example.txt
       25  ls
       26  cat example.txt
       27  history

Use the up and down arrow to retrieve previous commands

---

# Path

`PATH` is the environment variable to control where commands are found

It is a list of paths (directories) separated by `:` colons

    .terminal
    $ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:...

When you enter a command, bash checks the first directory in your path and if it finds a file with the same name in that directory, it executes that file. If it does not find a file, then it tries the next directory in your path, and keeps going until it finds one or reaches the end of your path.

Since it is possible to have mutliple version of the same command installed, or to install commands in different locations, as we start installing more programs, it is important to understand this concept.

---

# tr

The contents of the `PATH` variable can be hard to read in its natural `:` separated format. Fortunately we can fix that with the help of another command called `tr`.

The `tr` command is used to translate the input and then print the result of the translation in the output. We can convert each `:` in the PATH into a new-line character. This has the result of printing each directory of your path one a separate line, making it much easier to read:

    .terminal
    $ echo $PATH | tr : '\n'
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/bin
    /bin
    /usr/sbin
    /sbin

---

# which

If you want to figure out where a command actually is on your computer, possibly to verify the correct version is being used, you could use the trick we used on the last slide to print out each entry in your path, and then use `ls` to check each directory see if there is a program there, but that is a tedious and error-prone way to do it.

Thankfully we have the `which` is a command to do that job for us. Simply run `which` with the name of the program you are looking for and it will output the full path of the program:

    .terminal
    $ which ls
    /bin/ls
    $ which grep
    /usr/bin/grep
    $ which brew
    /usr/local/bin/brew

---

# export

When you set a variable, it is not "exported" by default:

    .terminal
    $ FIRST_NAME='Paul'
    $ echo $FIRST_NAME
    Paul
    $ env | grep FIRST_NAME
    $

If a variable is not exported, other programs, such as `env`, are not able to read that variable.

Use `export` to export the variable:

    .terminal
    $ export FIRST_NAME
    $ env | grep FIRST_NAME
    FIRST_NAME=Paul

---

# Configuration Files

There are some variables that you will want to set or modify every time you start a bash session. To allow for that, bash looks for a file called `.bash_profile` in your home directory when bash starts up. If the file exists, it executes each line of the file.

There is a command called `date` that prints out the current time:

    .terminal
    $ date
    Sat Feb  8 15:29:09 EST 2014

Let's append this command to the end of the `.bash_profile` file in your home directory:

    .terminal
    $ cd
    $ echo 'date' >> .bash_profile

Now start a new iTerm tab by pressing _cmd + t_. You should see the date printed out.

---

# Processes

You computer has multiple processes running at the same time

You can list them using the `ps` command

Use `ps aux` to list "all" processes, show the "user" and show the "eXtra" info

Each process has an id

Start a program called `irb`:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ irb
    >>

]

We'll learn more about what this program is later, but for now, know that it runs forever waiting for you to enter some commands. In a new iTerm tab, combine `ps` with `grep` to find the `irb` process:

    .terminal
    $ ps aux | grep irb
    paul          33629   0.0  0.0  2423356  11:37AM   0:00.00 grep irb
    paul          33015   0.0  0.3  2472492  11:34AM   0:00.43 irb

Use `kill` to terminate a process

    .terminal
    $ kill 33015
    $ ps aux | grep irb
    paul         33761   0.0  0.0  2432768   11:38AM   0:00.00 grep irb

By default, `kill` asks a process to shutdown. Use `kill -9` to terminate it immediately.

---

# Security and Permissions

Unix was designed as a multi-user OS, where different people would be logged in to the same system at the same time. To users from interferring with each other, security was built-in.

Files, directories and processes are all owned by the user that created them. `ls -l` shows the ownership and permissions of each file:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ ls -l
    drwx------+  49 paul  staff  1666 Feb  6 14:29 Documents
    drwxr-xr-x+   5 paul  staff   170 Dec 27 11:40 Public

]

Here is part of the output from `ls`. In the first column of output is the file permissions. The first character `d` indicates the file is a directory.

The next 3 characters 1st column represent the permissions on the file for the user that owns the file. The 3rd column of output shows the owner is `paul`. Since each of these characters are filled in (not a hyphen), that means the owner (paul) as all 3 permissions, which are **r**ead, **w**rite and e**x**ecute.

The next 3 characters of the 1st column represent the permissions for any other users in the group the file is owned by. The 4th column shows the group is `staff`. Each user on the system can belong to 1 or more groups. In the case of the `Documents` directory, all 3 characters are a hyphen, indicating users in the group (staff) cannot read, write or execute this directory. However, the `Public` directory has `r-x`, which means the group (staff) can read and execute the directory, but not write to it.

The last 3 characters of the 1st column represent the permissions for any other users on the system that aren't in the staff group.

![File Permissions](img/file_perms.png)

From [http://2buntu.com/1076/understanding-file-permissions/](http://2buntu.com/1076/understanding-file-permissions/)

---

# Super User

On all Unix-based OSes, there is a super user account known as **root**. It is called root because it is typically the user that can modify the files and directories in the root directory.

Security restrictions on files and processes do not apply to the super user. The super user can read, write, execute and file and kill any process.

If you want to perform as command as the super user, you use the command `sudo`, which is short for **s**uper **u**ser **d**o:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ tail /etc/sudoers
    tail: /etc/sudoers: Permission denied
    $ sudo tail /etc/sudoers
    Password:

    # Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands
    # %wheel    ALL=(ALL) ALL

    # Same thing without a password
    # %wheel    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

    # Samples
    # %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /cdrom,/sbin/umount /cdrom
    # %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

]

`tail` is a command like `cat`, only it only outputs the last few lines of a file. When I first tried to use it, I got a permission denied error. When I used `sudo`, I was asked to enter my own password (as a security percaution), and then the command was executed as the super user, so I did not get a permission denied error. Everything after `Password:` is the contents of the file.
